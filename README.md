# dotfiles
My dot files

## Description
Some dot files useful for me. Be free to use them.
Currently only my bash_profile and vim stuff.

## Installation
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gsantovena/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install-dotfiles.sh
```
This will create symlinks in your $HOME to the files listed in the variable 'files' within the script.
